# Destiny 2 Unpacker
Put oodle dll in same directory. The oodle dll is from Destiny 2 directory.

Valid for all Destiny 2: Beyond Light packages from version 3.0.0.0 onward.

This is a C++ "version" of my Python code that uses bcrypt for the AES-GCM-128 decryption.

Requires Sarge to build for command line args

-----

Usage: `DestinyUnpackerCPP.exe -p "path to packages" -i input package id -w (converts to wav)`

(Package ID here refers to 02f6 or 0144 for example)

Modified to export .WEM files by nblock, with major help from Philip & HighRTT

Default output folder is in a folder called "`output pkgid`" in the same directory as the exe. 

-----

Obvious thanks to Mont for making his code public

Thanks to Philip for helping me to get it extracting .WEMs

Thanks to HighRTT for helping out a lot
